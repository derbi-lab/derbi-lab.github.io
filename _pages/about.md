## Brief Biography
<div style="text-align: justify;">
Currently I am an Assistant Professor in the Department of Computer Science at the University of Alabama in Huntsville (UAH). 
I completed a MS and Ph.D. in Computer Science from Florida State University in 2017. After that I worked as a postdoctoral
associate at the University of Central Florida working on projects funded by the Air Force Research Laboratory, Munitions 
Directorate. I joined UAH in 2022 and run the DERBI Lab at UAH. My research interests are broadly in AI, Machine Learning
and Data Science with applications to image processing especially in the biology and remote sensing.

## Research
<div style="text-align: justify;">
I am interested in applying AI and machine learning techniques for inference with images. I have worked extensively with images
in biology for the tasks of segmentation of macromolecular structures from electron tomographic and electron microscopic images.
More recently, I have started working with satellite imagery with focus on remote sensing applications like tracking land cover
changes, identification of impervious surfaces etc. I am also interested in design of novel deep learning architectures. I have 
worked extensively on design of novel activation functions and pre-processing techniques for efficient inference. My work in this
area has addressed problems in low power regimen like inference in radio frequency domain which are often done in hardware limited
platforms. My work has been funded by the US Air Force Research Laboratory and has applications in defence related areas.
